# 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

## LeetCode [82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii/)

### Description

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, _delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list_. Return _the linked list **sorted** as well_.

**Example 1:**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

```text
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]
```

**Example 2:**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

```text
Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
* The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.

Linked List

### Solution

A dummy head is created and connects to `head`. Assign 3 pointers onto the linked list: `pre` \(which starts from the dummy head\), `cur` \(which starts from `head`\) and `next` \(which is only initialized when used\). Traverse the linked list with `cur`. The loop condition is `cur != nil && cur.Next != nil`. There are 2 scenarios in the loop. If `cur`'s next value is NOT equal to that of `cur`, it means that the node `cur` pointing to needs to be preserved. Thus, just move forward and assign `pre` to the `cur`'s old position. Otherwise, we find a string of duplicated nodes and `cur` is pointing to the head of it. We use `next` to find the next node whose value is not same as `cur`'s. When we find, we assign `pre.Next` to `next`, and move `cur` to `pre` because cur will move one step forward after every single loop.  At last, we return the next node of dummy head.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
// code here.
func deleteDuplicates(head *ListNode) *ListNode {
    if head == nil || head.Next == nil {
		    return head
	  }
    dummyHead := &ListNode{-114514, head}
    pre := dummyHead
    for cur := head; cur != nil && cur.Next != nil; cur = cur.Next {
        if cur.Val != cur.Next.Val {
            pre = cur
            continue
        }
        next := cur.Next
        for next != nil && cur.Val == next.Val {
            next = next.Next
        }
        pre.Next = next
        cur = pre
    }
    return dummyHead.Next
}
```
