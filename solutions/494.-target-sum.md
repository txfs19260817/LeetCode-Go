# 494. Target Sum

## LeetCode [494. Target Sum](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/target-sum)

### Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`.

You want to build an **expression** out of nums by adding one of the symbols `'+'` and `'-'` before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.

* For example, if `nums = [2, 1]`, you can add a `'+'` before `2` and a `'-'` before `1` and concatenate them to build the expression `"+2-1"`.

Return the number of different **expressions** that you can build, which evaluates to `target`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
-1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 3
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [1], target = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
* `0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 1000`
* `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

### Solution

We denote `sum` as the sum of `nums`, and `neg` as the sum of all elements whose sign is `-`. Then we can obtain $$(sum−neg)−neg=sum−2⋅neg=target$$ , then we obtain $$neg=(sum−target)/2$$ . Now our goal is to find a subset of `nums` whose sum is `neg`. 

We use Dynamic Programming strategy and build a 2D-array `dp`, and `dp[i][j]` represents the number of combination of some of elements in `nums[:i]` whose sum is `j`. 

* If `num[i]>j`, we will not pick it, and `dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j]`;
* Otherwise, if we pick it, we will have extra `dp[i-1][j-num[i]]` choices, meaning that `dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j]+dp[i-1][j-num[i]]`.

Finally, the answer is `dp[len(nums)][neg]`.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n\times (sum-target))$$
* Space complexity: $$O(sum-target)$$

### Code

```go
func findTargetSumWays(nums []int, target int) int {
	var sum int
	for _, num := range nums {
		sum += num
	}
	diff := sum - target
	if diff < 0 || diff%2 == 1 {
		return 0
	}
	neg := diff / 2
	dp := make([]int, neg+1)
	dp[0] = 1
	for _, num := range nums {
		for j := neg; j >= num; j-- {
			dp[j] += dp[j-num]
		}
	}
	return dp[neg]
}
```
