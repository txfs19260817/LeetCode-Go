# 881. Boats to Save People

## LeetCode [881. Boats to Save People](title)

### Description

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return _the minimum number of boats to carry every given person_.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 104`
* `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 104`

Two Pointers, Greedy

### Solution

Sort the given array and assign two pointers \(due to the capacity\) at both ends of it. If the sum of both people's weight makes the overload of a boat, meaning that only the heavier person can be loaded on the boat, we only move the right pointer towarding to center and increase the result by 1. Otherwise, we also move the left pointer because this person can also be fitted into the boat. When two pointers overlap with each other, we also add 1 onto the result. 

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n\log(n))$$, which depends on the sort algorithm;
* Space complexity: $$O(\log(n))$$, which depends on the sort algorithm.

### Code

```go
func numRescueBoats(people []int, limit int) int {
	ans, l, r := 0, 0, len(people)-1
	sort.Ints(people)
	for l <= r {
		if people[l]+people[r] <= limit {
			l++
		}
		r--
		ans++
	}
	return ans
}
```
