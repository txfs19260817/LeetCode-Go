# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

## LeetCode [80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](title)

### Description

Given a sorted array _nums_ , remove the duplicates [**in- place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that duplicates appeared at most _twice_ and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by **modifying the input array**[**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O\(1\) extra memory.

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference** , which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.

Internally you can think of this:

```text
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
* `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
* `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

Array, Two Pointers

### Solution

This is a general solution for _removing duplicates from the given sorted array such that duplicates appeared at most_ `k` _times and return the new length_. We assign a writer pointer `w` to the first position of the array, and use another pointer to traverse the array.

* Keep the first `k` elements;
* if the current visited value is not equal to the value at `w-k` , the position `w` pointing to will be overwritten by the current value.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
func removeDuplicates(nums []int) int {
	process := func (k int) int {
		var w int // writer pointer
		for _, v := range nums {
			if w<k || nums[w-k] != v {
				nums[w] = v
				w++
			}
		}
		return w
	}
	return process(2)
}
```
