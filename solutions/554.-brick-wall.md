# 554. Brick Wall

## LeetCode [554. Brick Wall](title)

### Description

There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the **top** to the **bottom** and cross the **least** bricks.

The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right.

If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.

**You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.**

**Example:**

```text
Input: [[1,2,2,1],
        [3,1,2],
        [1,3,2],
        [2,4],
        [3,1,2],
        [1,3,1,1]]
Output: 2
```

**Note:**

1. The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won't exceed INT\_MAX.
2. The number of bricks in each row is in range \[1,10,000\]. The height of wall is in range \[1,10,000\]. Total number of bricks of the wall won't exceed 20,000.

Hash Table

### Solution

To obtain the least bricks, we can compute the most edges first and return `len(wall) - maxEdges` finally. To achieve this, we initialize a hash table whose key is the position of edge and value is the number of edges at this position. Thus, for each line, we use variable `i` to accumulate the width of each brick and increase that hash table `pos2edges[i]` by 1.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(mn)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(mn)$$

### Code

```go
func leastBricks(wall [][]int) int {
	pos2edges := map[int]int{}
	for _, widths := range wall {
		var i int
		for _, w := range widths[:len(widths)-1] {
			i += w
			pos2edges[i]++
		}
	}
	var maxEdges int
	for _, e := range pos2edges {
		if maxEdges < e {
			maxEdges = e
		}
	}
	return len(wall) - maxEdges
}
```
