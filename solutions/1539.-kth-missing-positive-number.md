# 1539. Kth Missing Positive Number

## LeetCode [1539. Kth Missing Positive Number](title)

### Description

Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in a **strictly increasing order** , and an integer `k`.

_Find the_`kth`  _positive integer that is missing from this array._

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
* `1 <= k <= 1000`
* `arr[i] < arr[j]` for `1 <= i < j <= arr.length`

### Solution

We use a variable `i` to emulate traversing the array `[1,2,3,...]`. Also, we assign a pointer p at the first position of `arr`. We compare `i` and `arr[p]`. If `i` is smaller, it means that `i` is a missing number, so decrease `k` by 1. Otherwise, `i` catches `arr[p]`. Thus, we move `p` one step forward. We keep doing this comparison until `k` is 0. Finally, we return `i - 1` \(because there is an extra `i++` after exiting from the loop\).

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
func findKthPositive(arr []int, k int) int {
	var i, p int
	for i = 1; k != 0; i++ {
		if p < len(arr) && i == arr[p] {
			p++
			continue
		}
		k--
	}
	return i - 1
}
```
