# 1460. Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Sub-arrays

## LeetCode [1460. Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Sub-arrays](title)

### Description

Given two integer arrays of equal length `target` and `arr`.

In one step, you can select any **non-empty sub-array** of `arr` and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.

Return _True_ if you can make `arr` equal to `target`, or _False_ otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:
1- Reverse sub-array [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]
2- Reverse sub-array [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]
3- Reverse sub-array [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]
There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do so.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: target = [7], arr = [7]
Output: true
Explanation: arr is equal to target without any reverses.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: target = [1,12], arr = [12,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: target = [3,7,9], arr = [3,7,11]
Output: false
Explanation: arr doesn't have value 9 and it can never be converted to target.
```

**Constraints:**

* `target.length == arr.length`
* `1 <= target.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= target[i] <= 1000`
* `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

### Solution

Essentially, this problem is equivalent to check if both arrays share the same elements.

#### Solution 1:

Sort both arrays and check each pair of values.

#### Solution 2:

We can use a hash table to check if there is an element that only appears once. Return false if so.

### Complexity

#### Solution 1:

* Time complexity: $$O(n\log(n))$$
* Space complexity: $$O(\log(n))$$, which is equivalent to the space complexity of quick sort algorithm.

#### Solution 2:

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as the range of element is given.

### Code

#### Solution 1:

```go
func canBeEqual(target []int, arr []int) bool {
	var m [1001]int
	for i := 0; i < len(target); i++ {
		m[target[i]]++
		m[arr[i]]--
	}
	for _, n := range m {
		if n != 0 {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}
```

#### Solution 2:

```go
func canBeEqual1(target []int, arr []int) bool {
	sort.Ints(target)
	sort.Ints(arr)
	for i := 0; i < len(target); i++ {
		if target[i] != arr[i] {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}
```
