# 205. Isomorphic Strings

## LeetCode [205. Isomorphic Strings](title)

### Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
* `t.length == s.length`
* `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.

### Solution

We build the Bijection between two characters at the same index of `s` and `t` respectively with 2 maps. If any conflict occurs at index i \(`s2t[s[i]] != t[i]` or `t2s[t[i]] != s[i]`\), we return false immediately. Finally, return true.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
func isIsomorphic(s string, t string) bool {
	s2t, t2s := map[byte]byte{}, map[byte]byte{}
	for i := range s {
		x, y := s[i], t[i]
		if s2t[x] > 0 && s2t[x] != y || t2s[y] > 0 && t2s[y] != x {
			return false
		}
		s2t[x], t2s[y] = y, x
	}
	return true
}
```
