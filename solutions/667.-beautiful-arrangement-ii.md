# 667. Beautiful Arrangement II

## LeetCode [667. Beautiful Arrangement II](title)

### Description

Given two integers `n` and `k`, you need to construct a list which contains `n` different positive integers ranging from `1` to `n` and obeys the following requirement:  
Suppose this list is \[a1, a2, a3, ... , an\], then the list \[\|a1 - a2\|, \|a2 - a3\|, \|a3 - a4\|, ... , \|an-1 - an\|\] has exactly `k` distinct integers.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Explanation: The [1, 2, 3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1, 1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [1, 3, 2]
Explanation: The [1, 3, 2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2, 1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
```

**Note:**

1. The `n` and `k` are in the range `1 <= k < n <= 10^4`.

Array

### Solution

We first append number \[1, k+1\] to the result array from two ends of the interval toward the middle interchangeably, to construct the first k-1 distinct integers. Then, we leave the remaining numbers \[k+2, n\] in the result for the last one distinct interger \(which is 1\).

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

### Code

```go
func constructArray(n int, k int) []int {
	l, r, ans := 1, k+1, make([]int, 0, n)
	for l <= r {
		ans = append(ans, l)
		l++
		if l <= r {
			ans = append(ans, r)
			r--
		}
	}
	for i := k + 2; i <= n; i++ {
		ans = append(ans, i)
	}
	return ans
}
```
