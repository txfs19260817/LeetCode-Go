# 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings

## LeetCode [583. Delete Operation for Two Strings](title)

### Description

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return _the minimum number of **steps** required to make_ `word1` _and_ `word2` _the same_.

In one **step** , you can delete exactly one character in either string.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
Output: 4
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
* `word1` and `word2` consist of only lowercase English letters.

### Solution

双串LCS问题。按本题操作后得到的结果就是最长公共子序列，因此删除掉的字符数目就是两字符串长度和减去2倍LCS。

Follow the instruction and the processed 2 strings we obtained are ought to the same as that in LeetCode [1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/). Thus, the result is equal to `len(word1) + len(word2) - 2*lcs`.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n^2)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(n^2)$$

### Code

```go
func minDistance(word1 string, word2 string) int {
	lcs := longestCommonSubsequence(word1, word2)
	return len(word1) + len(word2) - 2*lcs
}

func longestCommonSubsequence(text1 string, text2 string) int {
	dp := make([][]int, len(text1)+1)
	for i := range dp {
		dp[i] = make([]int, len(text2)+1)
	}
	for i := 1; i <= len(text1); i++ {
		for j := 1; j <= len(text2); j++ {
			if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1] {
				dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]
			} else {
				dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j])
			}
		}
	}
	return dp[len(text1)][len(text2)]
}

func max(a, b int) int {
	if a > b {
		return a
	}
	return b
}
```
