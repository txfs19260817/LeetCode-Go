# 49. Group Anagrams

## LeetCode [49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

### Description

Given an array of strings `strs`, group **the anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= strs.length <= 104`
* `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
* `strs[i]` consists of lower-case English letters.

### Solution

Two strings are anagrams if and only if their character counts \(respective number of occurrences of each character\) are the same.

We use a map to group anagrams, whose key type is `[26]int` for count characters of a word and value type is `[]string` to collect words. For example, if `'a'` occurred in a word, we get the element at position 0 of `[26]int` increased by 1. Finally, we append all values of the map to a 2D string array as the return value.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n(k+26))$$, `n` for the length of `strs`; k for the length of the longest word.
* Space complexity: $$O(n(k+26))$$

### Code

```go
func groupAnagrams(strs []string) [][]string {
	var ans [][]string
	m := map[[26]int][]string{}
	for _, s := range strs {
		var key [26]int
		for _, c := range s {
			key[c-'a']++
		}
		m[key] = append(m[key], s)
	}
	for _, strings := range m {
		ans = append(ans, strings)
	}
	return ans
}
```
