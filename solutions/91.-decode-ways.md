# 91. Decode Ways

## LeetCode [91. Decode Ways](title)

### Description

A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping: 'A' -&gt; "1" 'B' -&gt; "2" ... 'Z' -&gt; "26"

To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above \(there may be multiple ways\). For example, `"11106"` can be mapped into:

* `"AAJF"` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
* `"KJF"` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `"06"` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `"6"` is different from `"06"`.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return _the **number** of ways to **decode** it_.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: s = "0"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no character that is mapped to a number starting with 0.
The only valid mappings with 0 are 'J' -> "10" and 'T' -> "20", neither of which start with 0.
Hence, there are no valid ways to decode this since all digits need to be mapped.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 100`
* `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero\(s\).

### Solution

We initialize an array `f` with `len(s)+1` elements to keep track of Decode Ways of each substring starting from 0. There are 2 cases need to be considered:

* `f[i] += f[i-1]` when `s[i-1] != '0'`
* `f[i] += f[i-2]` when `s[i-2] != '0'` and `s[i-2]*10+s[i-1] <= 26`

Also, we need consider the edge case f\[0\]=1 because the empty string only has 1 decode way.

Since the state `f[i]` only depends on its previous 2 states, we can use 3 variables to substitute an array to save space overhead.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
// Space optimized
func numDecodings(s string) int {
	a, b, c := 0, 1, 0 // idx=i-2,i-1,i
	for i := 1; i <= len(s); i++ {
		c = 0
		if s[i-1] != '0' {
			c += b
		}
		if i > 1 && s[i-2] != '0' && (s[i-2]-'0')*10+(s[i-1]-'0') <= 26 {
			c += a
		}
		a, b = b, c
	}
	return c
}

// DP
func numDecodings(s string) int {
	f := make([]int, len(s)+1)
	f[0] = 1
	for i := 1; i <= len(s); i++ {
		if s[i-1] != '0' {
			f[i] += f[i-1]
		}
		if i > 1 && s[i-2] != '0' && (s[i-2]-'0')*10+(s[i-1]-'0') <= 26 {
			f[i] += f[i-2]
		}
	}
	return f[len(s)]
}
```
