# 331. Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree

## LeetCode [331. Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree](title)

### Description

One way to serialize a binary tree is to use **preorder traversal**. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as `'#'`.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/12/pre-tree.jpg)

For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string `"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"`, where `'#'` represents a null node.

Given a string of comma-separated values `preorder`, return `true` if it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree.

It is **guaranteed** that each comma-separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character `'#'` representing null pointer.

You may assume that the input format is always valid.

* For example, it could never contain two consecutive commas, such as `"1,,3"`.

**Example 1:** 

```text
Input: preorder = "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:** 

```text
Input: preorder = "1,#"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= preorder.length <= 104`
* `preoder` consist of integers in the range `[0, 100]` and `'#'` separated by commas `','`.

**Follow up:** Find an algorithm without reconstructing the tree.

### Solution

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2834%29.png)

It is always true for a Tree or a Directed Graph that **the sum of in-degree of all nodes is equal to the sum of out-degree of all nodes**. There are 3 types of nodes:

* Root: in-degree = 0, out-degree = 2;
* Non-leaf \(expect the root\): in-degree = 1, out-degree = 2;
* Leaf: in-degree = 1, out-degree = 0;

Based on these facts, we can initialize a variable `degree = 1` and iterate over the splitted input. In the loop, we decrease degree by 1 which is the in-degree \(this is also why we initialize degree with 1 since the root has no in-degree\). At this time, if `degree < 0` we can early return false, because it should not be a negative value since we have not visited its children yet. Then, `degree += 2` if it is a non-leaf node, a.k.a. "\#". At last, we return `degree == 0` to validate if it is a legal tree.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
func isValidSerialization(preorder string) bool {
	nodes, degree := strings.Split(preorder, ","), 1 // degree is init with 1 since root has no in-degree
	for _, node := range nodes {
		degree--
		if degree < 0 { // degree should not be non-pos number since we have not visited its children yet
			return false
		}
		if node != "#" {
			degree += 2
		}
	}
	return degree == 0
}
```
