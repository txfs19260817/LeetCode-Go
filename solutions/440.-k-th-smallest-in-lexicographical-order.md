# 440. K-th Smallest in Lexicographical Order

## LeetCode [440. K-th Smallest in Lexicographical Order](title)

### Description

Given integers `n` and `k`, find the lexicographically k-th smallest integer in the range from `1` to `n`.

Note: 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 109.

**Example:**

```text
Input:
n: 13   k: 2

Output:
10

Explanation:
The lexicographical order is [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], so the second smallest number is 10.

### Solution

In essential, we can build a 10-ary tree to represent a set of number from 1 to n in Lexicographical Order. We can obtain the k-th number by moving a pointer `cur` from 1 with `k-1` steps in pre-order manner. To jump over a bunch of nodes, we can check if the k-th number is belonging the child of `cur`. To achieve this, we calculate the number of nodes \(which should not be greater than `n`\) and compare it with `k`. If the number is smaller than `k`, we substract these nodes from `k` and move `cur` by 1 step horizontally. Otherwise, we let `k--` and `cur*=10`, which means we dive into the next level and find the k-th number on this level. When `k==0`, we return `cur`.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(k)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
func findKthNumber(n int, k int) int {
	getSteps := func(n, prefix int) (count int) {
		for cur, next := prefix, prefix+1; cur <= n; cur, next = cur*10, next*10 {
			count += min(n+1, next) - cur
		}
		return
	}
	cur, k := 1, k-1 // skip 0
	for k > 0 {
		steps := getSteps(n, cur)
		if k >= steps { // right
			k -= steps
			cur++
		} else { // down
			k--
			cur *= 10
		}
	}
	return cur
}

func min(a, b int) int {
	if a < b {
		return a
	}
	return b
}
```
