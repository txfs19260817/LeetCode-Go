# 69. Sqrt\(x\)

## LeetCode [69. Sqrt\(x\)](title)

### Description

Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return _the square root of_ `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated** , and only **the integer part** of the result is returned.

**Example 1:** 

```text
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:** 

```text
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

### Tags

Math, Binary Search

### Solution

Perform Binary Search between `0` and `x/2+1` \(for `x=1`\). If x is not a perfect square number, i.e., we cannot find `mid^2 == x`, we evaluate if the square of the right pointer is smaller than `x` first, then check the left one. The reason is we have to find the **maximum** value whose square is no greater than `x`.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(\log(x))$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
func mySqrt(x int) int {
	l, r := 0, x/2+1
	for l+1 < r {
		mid := l + (r-l)/2
		square := mid * mid
		if square == x {
			return mid
		}
		if square < x {
			l = mid
		} else {
			r = mid
		}
	}
	if r*r <= x {
		return r
	}
	return l
}
```
