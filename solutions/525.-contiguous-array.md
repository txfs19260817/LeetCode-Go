# 525. Contiguous Array

## LeetCode [525. Contiguous Array](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/contiguous-array/)

### Description

Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
```

**Note:** The length of the given binary array will not exceed 50,000.

Hash Table

### Solution

This problem is similar to LeetCode [523. Continuous Subarray Sum](523.-continuous-subarray-sum.md), and we are going to apply the prefix-sum stategy as well. The requirement is equivalent to find the longest subarray that contains an equal number of 1s and 0s. If we replace all 0s to -1, the sum of the target subarray is 0. Thus, we can use a prefix-sum array to compute sum values of all subarrays, and pick the longest one whose sum is 0. 

In fact, we do not need such prefix-sum array. Instead, we can use a counter variable to count 1s and 0s. When iterating over the input array, if we meet 1, then we increase the counter by 1; otherwise, we decrease it by 1. Also, we use a hash table that maps a first occurrence counter value to the index, initialized with `{0: -1}` representing an empty array. If a counter value appears twice, then we can find a subarray who starts from previous occurrence index and end with the current one. Record the length of this subarray if it is longer.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

### Code

```go
func findMaxLength(nums []int) int {
	ans, count, cnt2idx := 0, 0, map[int]int{0: -1}
	for i, num := range nums {
		if num == 1 {
			count++
		} else {
			count--
		}
		if preIdx, ok := cnt2idx[count]; ok {
			if ans < i-preIdx {
				ans = i - preIdx
			}
		} else {
			cnt2idx[count] = i
		}
	}
	return ans
}
```
