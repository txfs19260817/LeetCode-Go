# 645. Set Mismatch

## LeetCode [645. Set Mismatch](title)

### Description

You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contains all the numbers from `1` to `n`. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in `s` got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in **repetition of one** number and **loss of another** number.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return _them in the form of an array_.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 104`

### Solution

We try to visit all `nums[nums[i]-1]`. emulating that we move `nums[i]` to `i`th position. Every time we invert the element we visited.  If this number is encountered the second time, we find the duplicate, which is the first element of the output.

Then we traverse the array after inversion and find the only positive element. This element's index is the missing number, a.k.a the second element of the output.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
func findErrorNums(nums []int) []int {
	dup, missing := -1, 1
	for _, n := range nums {
		if nums[abs(n)-1] < 0 {
			dup = abs(n)
		} else {
			nums[abs(n)-1] *= -1
		}
	}
	for i := 1; i < len(nums); i++ {
		if nums[i] > 0 {
			missing = i + 1
		}
	}
	return []int{dup, missing}
}

func abs(a int) int {
	if a < 0 {
		return -1 * a
	}
	return a
}
```
