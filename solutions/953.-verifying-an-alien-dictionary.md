# 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary

## LeetCode [953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary](title)

### Description

In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 100`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
* `order.length == 26`
* All characters in `words[i]` and `order` are English lowercase letters.

Hash Table

### Solution

Before checking, we build a dictionary to map each character from `order` to its index. We compare each pair of adjacent words. Iterate over the former word.

* If the pointer on the `word[i]` is beyond the length of `word[i+1]`, return false. Because the latter mush longer than or equal to the former word if they share the same prefix;
* If `words[i][j] != words[i+1][j]`, retrieve the indices of both and they must obey the alien dictionary order. After evaluating, break here because the remain part will not be considered.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(mn)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
func isAlienSorted(words []string, order string) bool {
	dict := map[byte]int{}
	for i, c := range order {
		dict[byte(c)] = i
	}
	for i := 0; i < len(words)-1; i++ {
		for j := 0; j < len(words[i]); j++ {
			// if both words share the same prefix, the latter must ≥ the former
			if j >= len(words[i+1]) {
				return false
			}
			// the corresponding position must in alien dict order
			if words[i][j] != words[i+1][j] {
				if dict[words[i][j]] > dict[words[i+1][j]] {
					return false
				}
				break // the remain part will not be considered
			}
		}
	}
	return true
}
```
