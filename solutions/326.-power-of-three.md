# 326. Power of Three

## LeetCode [326. Power of Three](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/power-of-three/)

### Description

Given an integer `n`, return _`true` if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return `false`_.

An integer `n` is a power of three, if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 3^x`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 27
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 0
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: n = 9
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

* `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

### Solution

The largest `n` in interger-wise who is the power of 3 is `3^19 = 1162261467`, and its factors are only `3^x` where `x` ranges from 0 to 19. Thus, we only need to test if `3^19%n == 0`.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(1)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
func isPowerOfThree(n int) bool {
	return n > 0 && 1162261467%n == 0 // 3^19 < 2^31 - 1
}
```
