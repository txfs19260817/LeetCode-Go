# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## LeetCode [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](title)

### Description

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

* `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
* `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5000`
* `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
* All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
* `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

Array, Binary Search

### Solution

Perform binary search to find the precipice in the array, by comparing `nums[mid]` with the last element of the array. If `nums[mid]` is larger then move the left pointer to the middle index, otherwise move the right pointer. Finally, we return the smaller one of both `nums[start]` and `nums[end]`.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(\log(n))$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
func findMin(nums []int) int {
	start, end := 0, len(nums)-1
	for start+1 < end {
		mid := start + (end-start)/2
		if nums[mid] >= nums[end] {
			start = mid
		} else {
			end = mid
		}
	}
	if nums[start] < nums[end] {
		return nums[start]
	}
	return nums[end]
}
```
