# 692. Top K Frequent Words

## LeetCode [692. Top K Frequent Words](title)

### Description

Given a non-empty list of words, return the _k_ most frequent elements.

Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i", "love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
    Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], k = 4
Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words,
    with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
```

**Note:**

1. You may assume _k_ is always valid, 1 ≤ _k_ ≤ number of unique elements.
2. Input words contain only lowercase letters.

**Follow up:**

1. Try to solve it in _O_ \( _n_ log _k_ \) time and _O_ \( _n_ \) extra space.

### Solution

For other solutions see Reference section.

The first step is build a hash table who maps a word to its frequency. Then we invert this mapping with a 2D string slice, called `freq2word`. Its index is word frequency, and the element corresponding to each index in `freq2word` is an alphabetical-ordered string array, whose elements share the same frequency `index`. To keep each element of `freq2word` is sorted, we apply a binary search function to insert each incoming element instead of appending. 

After building `freq2word`, we iterate over it from right. If the length of the current element, which is a slice, is smaller than the result array's remaining capacity, we append all of them to the result. Otherwise, we append words of the current element to the result one by one until the length of the result array is `k`.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(\max(n,m\log(k)))$$, `m` is the number of unique words;
* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, actually `freq2word` stores `n` words.

### Code

```go
func topKFrequent(words []string, k int) []string {
	ans, word2freq, freq2word := make([]string, 0, k), map[string]int{}, make([][]string, len(words))
	for _, word := range words {
		word2freq[word]++
	}
	for w, f := range word2freq {
		if idx := sort.SearchStrings(freq2word[f], w); idx == len(freq2word[f]) {
			freq2word[f] = append(freq2word[f], w)
		} else {
			freq2word[f] = append(freq2word[f][:idx+1], freq2word[f][idx:]...)
			freq2word[f][idx] = w
		}
	}
	for i := len(freq2word) - 1; i >= 0 && len(ans) < k; i-- {
		if k-len(ans) > len(freq2word[i]) {
			ans = append(ans, freq2word[i]...)
			continue
		}
		for j := 0; len(ans) < k; j++ {
			ans = append(ans, freq2word[i][j])
		}
	}
	return ans
}
```
