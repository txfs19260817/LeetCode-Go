# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

## LeetCode [**116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node**](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/)\*\*\*\*

### Description

You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

```text
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Follow up:**

* You may only use constant extra space.
* Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the given tree is less than `4096`.
* `-1000 <= node.val <= 1000`

### Solution

Based on [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/), after collected all nodes in this layer, we connect them one after another.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, all nodes are visited;
* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$, the last layer contains `n/2` nodes.

### Code

```go
func connect(root *Node) *Node {
	if root == nil {
		return nil
	}
	q := []*Node{root}
	for i := 0; len(q) > 0; i++ {
		var p []*Node
		for j := 0; j < len(q); j++ {
			if q[j].Left != nil {
				p = append(p, q[j].Left)
			}
			if q[j].Right != nil {
				p = append(p, q[j].Right)
			}
		}
		for k := 0; k < len(p)-1; k++ {
			p[k].Next = p[k+1]
		}
		q = p
	}
	return root
}
```
