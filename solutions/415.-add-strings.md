# 415. Add Strings

## LeetCode [415. Add Strings](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/add-strings)

### Description

Given two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return _the sum of_ `num1` _and_ `num2` _as a string_.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104`
* `num1` and `num2` consist of only digits.
* `num1` and `num2` don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without using any built-in `BigInteger` library or converting the inputs to integer directly?

### Solution

Loop to add characters from "the lowest bit" of both strings, and the loop condition is neither of two pointers is out of index, or the carry bit is non-zero. Obtained the sum of two bits and the carry, we update the result string by concatenating `string(sum%10)` and the old result string, meaning that we combining the single digit of the current summation, which is the result of a higher bit, with the lower bits that we have already calculated. Meanwhile, do not forget to update the carry. Finally return the result string.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, `n` for the length of the longer string
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
func addStrings(num1 string, num2 string) string {
	var ans string
	var carry int
	for i, j := len(num1)-1, len(num2)-1; i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry != 0; i, j = i-1, j-1 {
		sum := carry
		if i >= 0 {
			sum += int(num1[i] - '0')
		}
		if j >= 0 {
			sum += int(num2[j] - '0')
		}
		ans = strconv.Itoa(sum%10) + ans
		carry = sum / 10
	}
	return ans
}
```
