# 1734. Decode XORed Permutation

## LeetCode [1734. Decode XORed Permutation](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/decode-xored-permutation/)

### Description

There is an integer array `perm` that is a permutation of the first `n` positive integers, where `n` is always **odd**.

It was encoded into another integer array `encoded` of length `n - 1`, such that `encoded[i] = perm[i] XOR perm[i + 1]`. For example, if `perm = [1,3,2]`, then `encoded = [2,1]`.

Given the `encoded` array, return _the original array_ `perm`. It is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: encoded = [3,1]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: If perm = [1,2,3], then encoded = [1 XOR 2,2 XOR 3] = [3,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: encoded = [6,5,4,6]
Output: [2,4,1,5,3]
```

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= n < 10^5`
* `n` is odd.
* `encoded.length == n - 1`

### Solution

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2833%29.png)

This problem is similar to but a little bit harder than LeetCode [1720. Decode XORed Array](1720.-decode-xored-array.md). The difference is that we do not know the first element of the target array `perm`. However, we can obtain this value by computing `perm[:] ^ perm[1:]` based on the knowledge that XOR is reversible. Given that "the array `perm` that is a permutation of the first `n` positive integers", we can formulate that `perm[:] = 1 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ n`. Shown in the figure above, which illustrated the relationship between `encoded` and `perm`, we know that `perm[1:] = encoded[1] ^ encoded[3] ... ^ encoded[n-1]`. Thus, we are able to obtain `perm[0]`, and get the following permutation via `perm[i] = perm[i-1] ^ encoded[i-1]`.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
func decode(encoded []int) []int {
	var total, odd int
	for i := 1; i <= len(encoded)+1; i++ {
		total ^= i
	}
	for i := 1; i < len(encoded); i += 2 {
		odd ^= encoded[i]
	}
	perm := make([]int, len(encoded)+1)
	perm[0] = total ^ odd
	for i := 1; i < len(perm); i++ {
		perm[i] = perm[i-1] ^ encoded[i-1]
	}
	return perm
}
```
