# 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II

## LeetCode [154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II](title)

### Description

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` might become:

* `[4,5,6,7,0,1,4]` if it was rotated `4` times.
* `[0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` that may contain **duplicates** , return _the minimum element of this array_.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5000`
* `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
* `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

**Follow up:** This is the same as [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-%20array/description/) but with duplicates. Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

### Solution

Based on the solution for LeetCode [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](title), we need to consider the case when `nums[mid] == nums[end]`. We can simply do `end--`, because though we cannot determine whether the minimum value is on the left side of `mid` or on the right side, we can remove `nums[end]` because `nums[mid]` is a substitute of that.

### Complexity

* Time complexity \(worst\): $$O(n)$$, if the elements in the array are exactly the same, we need to do for-loop `n` times.
* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

### Code

```go
func findMin(nums []int) int {
	start, end := 0, len(nums)-1
	for start+1 < end {
		mid := start + (end-start)/2
		if nums[mid] > nums[end] {
			start = mid
		} else if nums[mid] < nums[end] {
			end = mid
		} else { // 
			end--
		}
	}
	if nums[start] < nums[end] {
		return nums[start]
	}
	return nums[end]
}
```
