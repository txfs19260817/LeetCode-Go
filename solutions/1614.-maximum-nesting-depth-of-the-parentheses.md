# 1614. Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses

## LeetCode [1614. Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses](title)

### Description

A string is a **valid parentheses string** \(denoted **VPS** \) if it meets one of the following:

* It is an empty string `""`, or a single character not equal to `"("` or `")"`,
* It can be written as `AB` \(`A` concatenated with `B`\), where `A` and `B` are **VPS** 's, or
* It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a **VPS**.

We can similarly define the **nesting depth** `depth(S)` of any VPS `S` as follows:

* `depth("") = 0`
* `depth(C) = 0`, where `C` is a string with a single character not equal to `"("` or `")"`.
* `depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B))`, where `A` and `B` are **VPS** 's.
* `depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A)`, where `A` is a **VPS**.

For example, `""`, `"()()"`, and `"()(()())"` are **VPS** 's \(with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2\), and `")("` and `"(()"` are not **VPS** 's.

Given a **VPS** represented as string `s`, return _the **nesting depth** of_ `s`.

**Example 1:** 

```text
Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 100`
* `s` consists of digits `0-9` and characters `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, `'/'`, `'('`, and `')'`.
* It is guaranteed that parentheses expression `s` is a **VPS**.

### Solution

Define a variable to track the depth. If we come across '\(' then depth add 1; if '\)' then depth minus 1. We also need to update the max value of the depth, and return it as the result in the end.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

### Code

```go
func maxDepth(s string) int {
	var count, ans int
	for _, c := range s {
		if c == '(' {
			count++
			if count > ans {
				ans = count
			}
		} else if c == ')' {
			count--
		}
	}
	return ans
}
```
