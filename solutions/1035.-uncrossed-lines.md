# 1035. Uncrossed Lines

## LeetCode [1035. Uncrossed Lines](title)

### Description

We write the integers of `A` and `B` \(in the order they are given\) on two separate horizontal lines.

Now, we may draw _connecting lines_ : a straight line connecting two numbers `A[i]` and `B[j]` such that:

* `A[i] == B[j]`;
* The line we draw does not intersect any other connecting \(non-horizontal\) line.

Note that a connecting lines cannot intersect even at the endpoints: each number can only belong to one connecting line.

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: A = [1,4,2], B = [1,2,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from A[1]=4 to B[2]=4 will intersect the line from A[2]=2 to B[1]=2.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: A = [2,5,1,2,5], B = [10,5,2,1,5,2]
Output: 3
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 500`
2. `1 <= B.length <= 500`
3. `1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 2000`

### Solution

This problem is totally the same as LeetCode [1143. Longest Common Subsequence](1143.-longest-common-subsequence.md).

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

### Code

```go
func maxUncrossedLines(nums1 []int, nums2 []int) int {
	dp := make([][]int, len(nums1)+1)
	for i := range dp {
		dp[i] = make([]int, len(nums2)+1)
	}
	for i := 1; i <= len(nums1); i++ {
		for j := 1; j <= len(nums2); j++ {
			if nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1] {
				dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]
			} else {
				dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j])
			}
		}
	}
	return dp[len(nums1)][len(nums2)]
}

func max(a, b int) int {
	if a > b {
		return a
	}
	return b
}
```
