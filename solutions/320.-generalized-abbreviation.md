# 320. Generalized Abbreviation

## LeetCode [320. Generalized Abbreviation](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/generalized-abbreviation/)

### Description

A word's **generalized abbreviation** can be constructed by taking any number of non-overlapping substrings and replacing them with their respective lengths. For example, `"abcde"` can be abbreviated into `"a3e"` \(`"bcd"` turned into `"3"`\), `"1bcd1"` \(`"a"` and `"e"` both turned into `"1"`\), and `"23"` \(`"ab"` turned into `"2"` and `"cde"` turned into `"3"`\).

Given a string `word`, return _a list of all the possible **generalized abbreviations** of_ `word`. Return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: word = "word"
Output: ["4","3d","2r1","2rd","1o2","1o1d","1or1","1ord","w3","w2d","w1r1","w1rd","wo2","wo1d","wor1","word"]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: word = "a"
Output: ["1","a"]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word.length <= 15`
* `word` consists of only lowercase English letters.

Bit Manipulation

### Solution

We can observe that the result is sort of related to bits representation \(since the length of output is `2^n, n = len(word)`\). Thus, we iterate a bit-mask variable from `0` to `2^n-1`. \(e.g. for `word = "word"`, we iterate from `0000` to `1111`\), and rules to generate a word are:

* we initialize a counter variable to count continuous `1`, as well as a byte slice `w` whose capacity is `n`;
* we check bits of the current bit-mask one by one with the pointer `j`:
  * if the bit `bitmask[j]` is `1`, increase the counter by 1;
  * if the bit `bitmask[j]` is `0`, convert the counter type from integer to string only if the counter is greater than 0, and concatenate `w` to it, then clear the counter. Also, append `word[j]` to `w`.
* convert the counter type from integer to string only if the counter is greater than 0, and concatenate `w` to it.
* convert the type of `w` from `[]byte` to `string`, and append it to the result slice.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(n2^n)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

### Code

```go
func generateAbbreviations(word string) []string {
	bitmask := int(math.Pow(2, float64(len(word)))) - 1
	ans := make([]string, bitmask+1)
	for i := 0; i <= bitmask; i++ {
		count, w := 0, make([]byte, 0, len(word))
		for j := 0; j < len(word); j++ {
			if b := i >> j; b&1 == 1 {
				count++
			} else if b&1 == 0 {
				if count != 0 {
					w = append(w, []byte(strconv.Itoa(count))...)
					count = 0
				}
				w = append(w, word[j])
			}
		}
		if count != 0 {
			w = append(w, []byte(strconv.Itoa(count))...)
		}
		ans[i] = string(w)
	}
	return ans
}
```
