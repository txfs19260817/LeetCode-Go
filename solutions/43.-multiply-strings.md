# 43. Multiply Strings

## LeetCode [**43. Multiply Strings**](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/multiply-strings/)\*\*\*\*

### Description

Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

**Note:** You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200`
* `num1` and `num2` consist of digits only.
* Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zero, except the number `0` itself.

### Solution

If `m, n` are lengths of two strings respectively, the length of the product of both is either `m+n-1` or `m+n`. Based on this conclusion, we build an int array whose length is m+n to store the interim result. In particular, we add the product of `num1[i]` and `num2[j]` to `ints[i+j+1]`, because the carry of the result will be added to `ints[i+j]`. After multiplication, we process the carries on each bit. Finally, we trim the leading zero and return the result string converted from the array.

### Complexity

* Time complexity: $$O(mn)$$
* Space complexity: $$O(m+n)$$

### Code

```go
func multiply(num1 string, num2 string) string {
	if num1 == "0" || num2 == "0" {
		return "0"
	}
	var ans string
	ints := make([]int, len(num1)+len(num2))
	for i := len(num1) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
		for j := len(num2) - 1; j >= 0; j-- {
			ints[i+j+1] += int(num1[i]-'0') * int(num2[j]-'0')
		}
	}
	for i := len(ints) - 1; i > 0; i-- {
		ints[i-1] += ints[i] / 10
		ints[i] %= 10
	}
	for _, n := range ints {
		ans += strconv.Itoa(n)
	}
	// trim leading 0
	idx := 0
	for i, c := range ans {
		if c != '0' {
			idx = i
			break
		}
	}
	return ans[idx:]
}
```
