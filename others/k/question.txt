Question 1-
/*
We are building a program to manage a gym's membership. The gym has multiple 
members, each with a unique ID, name, and membership status. The program allows gym 
staff to add new members, update members status, and get membership statistics.
Definitions:
* A "member" is an object that represents a gym member. It has properties for the ID, 
name, and membership status.
* A "membership" is a class which is used for managing members in the gym.
*/
/*
To begin with, we present you with two tasks:
1-1) Read through and understand the code below. Please take as much time as necessary, 
and feel free to run the code.
1-2) The test for Membership is not passing due to a bug in the code. Make the necessary 
changes to Membership to fix the bug.

Question 2- Shopping List 
/*
You are going on a camping trip, but before you leave you need to buy groceries. To optimize 
your time spent in the store, instead of buying the items from your shopping list in order, 
you plan to buy everything you need from one department before moving to the next.
Given an unsorted list of products with their departments and a shopping list, return the 
time saved in terms of the number of department visits eliminated.
Example: 
products = [
 ["Cheese", "Dairy"],
 ["Carrots", "Produce"],
 ["Potatoes", "Produce"],
 ["Canned Tuna", "Pantry"],
 ["Romaine Lettuce", "Produce"],
 ["Chocolate Milk", "Dairy"],
 ["Flour", "Pantry"],
 ["Iceberg Lettuce", "Produce"],
 ["Coffee", "Pantry"],
 ["Pasta", "Pantry"],
 ["Milk", "Dairy"],
 ["Blueberries", "Produce"],
 ["Pasta Sauce", "Pantry"]
]
list1 = ["Blueberries", "Milk", "Coffee", "Flour", "Cheese", "Carrots"]
For example, buying the items from list1 in order would take 5 department visits, whereas 
your method would lead to only visiting 3 departments, a difference of 2 departments.
Produce(Blueberries)->Dairy(Milk)->Pantry(Coffee/Flour)->Dairy(Cheese)-
>Produce(Carrots) = 5 department visits
New: Produce(Blueberries/Carrots)->Pantry(Coffee/Flour)->Dairy(Milk/Cheese) = 3 
department visits
list2 = ["Blueberries", "Carrots", "Coffee", "Milk", "Flour", "Cheese"] => 2
list3 = ["Blueberries", "Carrots", "Romaine Lettuce", "Iceberg Lettuce"] => 0
list4 = ["Milk", "Flour", "Chocolate Milk", "Pasta Sauce"] => 2
list5 = ["Cheese", "Potatoes", "Blueberries", "Canned Tuna"] => 0
All Test Cases:
shopping(products, list1) => 2
shopping(products, list2) => 2
shopping(products, list3) => 0
shopping(products, list4) => 2
shopping(products, list5) => 0
Complexity Variable:
n: number of products
*/
Question 3 – Stock Price comparison
/*
We are developing a stock trading data management software that tracks the prices of 
different stocks over time and provides useful statistics.
The program includes three classes: `Stock`, `PriceRecord`, and `StockCollection`.
Classes:
* The `Stock` class represents data about a specific stock.
* The `PriceRecord` class holds information about a single price record for a stock.
* The `StockCollection` class manages a collection of price records for a particular stock 
and provides methods to retrieve useful statistics about the stock's prices.
*/
/*
2) We want to add a new function called "GetBiggestChange" to the StockCollection class. 
This function calculates and returns the largest absolute change in stock price between 
any two consecutive days in the price records of a stock along with the dates of the change 
in a list. For example, let's consider the following price records of a stock:
Price Records:
Price: 110 112 90 105
Date: 2023-06-29 2023-07-01 2023-06-25 2023-07-06
Stock price changes (sorted based on date):
Date: 2023-06-25 -> 2023-06-29 -> 2023-07-01 -> 2023-07-06
Price: 90 -> 110 -> 112 -> 105
Change: +20 +2 -7
In this case, the biggest absolute change in the stock price was +20, which occurred 
between 2023-06-25 and 2023-06-29. In this case, the function should return [20, "2023-
06-25", "2023-06-29"]
Two days are considered consecutive if there are no other days' data in between them in 
the price records based on their dates.
To assist you in testing this new function, we have provided the `TestGetBiggestChange` 
function.

Question 4 – TollBooth
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.IO;
/*
We are writing software to analyze logs for toll booths on a highway. This highway is a 
divided highway with limited access; the only way on to or off of the highway is through a 
toll booth.
There are three types of toll booths:
* ENTRY (E in the diagram) toll booths, where a car goes through a booth as it enters the 
highway.
* EXIT (X in the diagram) toll booths, where a car goes through a booth as it exits the 
highway.
* MAINROAD (M in the diagram), which have sensors that record a license plate as a car 
drives through at full speed.

1-1) Read through and understand the code and comments below. Feel free to run the code 
and tests.
1-2) The tests are not passing due to a bug in the code. Make the necessary changes to 
LogEntry to fix the bug.
 
*/
/*
We are interested in how many people are using the highway, and so we would like to count 
how many complete journeys are taken in the log file.
A complete journey consists of:
* A driver entering the highway through an ENTRY toll booth.
* The driver passing through some number of MAINROAD toll booths (possibly 0).
* The driver exiting the highway through an EXIT toll booth.
For example, the following excerpt of log lines contains complete journeys for the cars with 
JOX304 and THX138:
.
.
.
90750.191 JOX304 250E ENTRY
91081.684 JOX304 260E MAINROAD
91082.101 THX138 110E ENTRY
91483.251 JOX304 270E MAINROAD
91873.920 THX138 120E MAINROAD
91874.493 JOX304 280E EXIT
.
.
91982.102 THX138 290E EXIT
.
You may assume that the log only contains complete journeys, and there are no missing 
entries.
2-1) Write a function in LogFile named CountJourneys() that returns how many
 complete journeys there are in the given LogFile.

 * * ENTRY indicates which type of toll booth the vehicle went through. This is one of
 * "ENTRY", "EXIT", or "MAINROAD".
